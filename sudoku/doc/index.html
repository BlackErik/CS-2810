<p>This step has a similar structure to the previous one. Instead of
gathering a set of pencil marks that are used by a selected group of
cells, this step crosses off a set of pencil marks from a selected
group of cells. You will implement the function:</p>

<pre><code>clear_others(board, group, key, set) -&gt;
   0: nothing changed
   1: something changed
</code></pre>

<p>in the file <code>naked_sets.s</code>.</p>

<p>As in the previous step, <code>board</code> contains the address of the entire
board and <code>group</code> is an array of nine index values representing a
single group on the board. Similar to the previous step, <code>key</code>
identifies some of the cells in the list. However, this time the
<em>zeros</em> identify the cells of interest, while the <em>ones</em> identify
the cells to ignore.</p>

<p><code>used</code> contains a set of pencil marks that should be crossed off in
the identified cells, i.e., the ones whose positions in <code>key</code> are
marked by zeros.</p>

<p>Consider this pseudcode and compare it with the previous step:</p>

<pre><code>clear_others(board, group, key, set)
    changed = 0
    notset = ~set (flip all the bits)
    for index = 0; index &lt; 9; index++
        if key &amp; (1&lt;&lt;index) == 0
            board_index = group[index]
            elt = board[board_index]
            new_elt = elt &amp; notset
            if elt != new_elt
                board[board_index] = new_elt
                changed = 1
    return changed
</code></pre>

<p>To clear a set of bits we flip the bits in the set and the AND the
result with the board element (similar to a previous step).</p>

<p>Where the previous step collected all pencil marks from a set of
cells, this step crosses off pencils marks from the complementary
set of cells. It must also return 1 to indicate that anything
actually changed, or 0 to indicate that the operation did not change
anything.</p>
