<html><head></head><body><h2>Naked sets</h2>

<p>In this step you will calculate naked sets for the entire board:</p>

<pre><code>naked_sets(board, table) -&gt;
    0: nothing changed
    1: something changed
</code></pre>

<p>Iterate over the 27 groups of the board (similar to previous steps)
and call <code>single_pass</code> on each one.</p>

<p>You should return 1 if any changes were made (as reported by the
calls to <code>single_pass</code>) and 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>Note that calculating naked sets may reveal additional naked sets,
so the code that calls it (in <code>solve.s</code>) will call it repeatedly
until no more changes are reported.</p>
